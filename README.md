## Machine Learning
+ [Music Genre Classification](https://nbviewer.jupyter.org/github/mkissarli/data-science/blob/main/music_genre_classification/Music%20Genre%20Classification.ipynb) :: We use several papers to create a CNN that predicts the genre of a song. We do this by converting audio to a log-spectogram, and running it though the VGG-16 CNN, and produce an accuracy of 90% on unseen validation data.

## Analysis
+ [An Analysis into Countries happiness data.](https://nbviewer.jupyter.org/github/mkissarli/data-science/blob/main/2020_Happiness/2020-happiness.ipynb)
